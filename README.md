# Tasty Table
## Project Overview
Tasty Table is a web-based recipe search engine designed to help users discover new recipes and find inspiration for their next meal. Users can search for specific dishes, browse categories of cuisine, or tap the "Surprise me!" button for a random recipe suggestion.
Deployed website: [Tasty Table](https://tastytable.surge.sh/)

### Motivation
The project was born out of a personal need for diverse and accessible recipes after being diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, which necessitated a strict home cooking regimen. Realizing the struggle of finding daily cooking inspiration, the idea for Tasty Table was conceived as a solution to aid anyone on their culinary journey.

### Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* TheMealDB API
* Trello (organization)
* Behance/Dribbble (for design inspiration)
* [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/yIKa0PoH4TD2QenZeEqXrP/Tasty-Table?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=cVt1BPJI5deD3GWJ-1)

### Features
- Search Functionality: Users can search for specific recipes using the search bar.
- Random Recipe Button: When clicked, this button presents a random recipe to the user.
- Browse Categories: Users can browse through various food categories and select a specific category to view its meals.
- Meal Recipes: Users can select a specific meal to view its detailed recipe.

### Design Process
The design process started with low-fidelity wireframes sketched in Goodnotes. These were then translated into mid- and high-fidelity wireframes in Figma as the design evolved. The color palette, font choices (like the Lobster font for the logo), and responsiveness on various screen sizes were considered to create a simple and enjoyable user experience.

### Future Improvements
1. User Account & Favorites: Users could create accounts to save their favorite recipes.
2. Rating and Reviews: Allow users to rate and review recipes to provide feedback.
3. Advanced Search: Implement filters for dietary restrictions, cuisine types, cooking time, or meal type.
4. Grocery List Integration: Users could add the ingredients of a selected recipe to a grocery list.
