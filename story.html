                    <p class="story-paragraph">Our journey with Tasty Table began from a deeply personal place. After being diagnosed with an automimmune disease I found myself needing to strictly eat at home. This new lifestyle posed a challenging question every day: "What's for dinner?" It was during this period of adjustment and exploration that the idea for Tasty Table was born. I realized that I wasn't alone in my struggle to find inspiration in the kitchen, and I saw an opportunity to create a solution that could help many others as well.</p>

                    <h1 class="each-title">Our Journey</h1>
                    <p class="story-paragraph">Building Tasty Table was a journey filled with challenges and learning opportunities. One major challenge was finding an API that provided a diverse set of meals. After much searching, we discovered the MealDB API, which proved to be an excellent resource. Implementing session storage to pass and render data across different pages was another hurdle we overcame. Despite the hurdles, we persisted, driven by the desire to make home cooking a more enjoyable and accessible experience for all.</p>
